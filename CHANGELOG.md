### Forwords

> Theme activities were pretty low since 2019. I maintain the theme on my free time and in 2019 I became a dad. You may (or not) understand that it was hard for me to find time to maintain the project.
>
> I recently find a great motiviation to re-maintain with more frequent updates and releases!
>Some big changes will comes to try to use latest Hugo's improvements and features.
> The goal is to release the `1.0.0` for the end of this year.

I'd like to thank every existing contributors. And not only people that pushing code.
During that period, I've seen some people trying to help other people on issue! I really appreciate.

If you'd like to start helping you can firstly look on that list of labelled issues [good first issue, ideal for contribution, help wanted](https://github.com/kakawait/hugo-tranquilpeak-theme/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22%2C%22ideal+for+contribution%22%2C%22help+wanted%22)

### Breaking changes

#### Update Font Awesome to v5

Hugo Tranquilpeak now uses Font Awesome v5. In this new version, Font Awesome has separated web fonts in 3 categories: regular, solid and brands. Because of that, you now have to update your icons in the sidebar configuration and sharing options in the theme configuration to tell Font Awesome in which web fonts your icons are:

- fa: for regular and solid icon
  - fas: for solid icon only
  - far: for regular icon only
- fab: for brand icons

Some icon names have also changed, so if at the end of the process, some icons are not displayed, make sure they still exist here: Font Awesome v5 - icons

Here is an example to help you upgrade to the new version:

**Before (`config.toml`):**

#### Main section

Until now, Hugo Tranquilpeak was using hardcoded main section `post`. That force you to have the following content structure:

```
content/
  post/
    your-post.md
    other-post.md
```

Since `0.5.0-BETA` Hugo tranquilpeak will now follow official recommendation https://gohugo.io/functions/where/#mainsections.

You can configure your main(s) section(s) from `config.toml`

```toml
[params]
  mainSections = ['posts']
```

but by default

> If the user has not set this config parameter in their site config, it will default to the section with the most pages.

- Remove algolia search if site config is not enable ([#283](https://github.com/kakawait/hugo-tranquilpeak-theme/issues/283))

- Add swedish translation ([#345](https://github.com/kakawait/hugo-tranquilpeak-theme/pull/345)) (thank you [flojon](https://github.com/flojon))

### Breaking changes

#### Do not support anymore Hugo version < 0.53!

As `.Hugo` is deprecated, it has been replace by the global function `hugo` which appears in ([version 0.53](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/tag/v0.53)).

`coverImage` from `config.toml` now more consistent by do not fix default static folder to `images` (see [#327](https://github.com/kakawait/hugo-tranquilpeak-theme/issues/327) for more details).
`coverImage` from `param` will now always based on base path and not relative to current url, thus

```yml
coverImage: img/a.jpg
```

will the be the same as

```yml
coverImage: /img/a.jpg
```

## [0.4.4-BETA](https://github.com/kakawait/hugo-tranquilpeak-theme/milestone/19) - 09 sep 2018

- Revamp _open sidebar_ behavior to not push the content out of container ([#278](https://github.com/kakawait/hugo-tranquilpeak-theme/issues/278)) (thank you [johnsoncodehk](https://github.com/johnsoncodehk))

- Typo fix from `highligth.js` to correct on `highlight.js` ([#231](https://github.com/kakawait/hugo-tranquilpeak-theme/pull/231)) (thank you [@zacbook](https://github.com/zacbook))
- Russian translation enhancement ([#227](https://github.com/kakawait/hugo-tranquilpeak-theme/pull/227))

### Breaking changes

Since I did an error on `highlight.js` for parameter `syntaxHighlighter`, sorry but you have to change it again for the correct typo

```toml
[params]
  syntaxHighlighter = "highlight.js"
```

## [0.4.2-BETA](https://github.com/kakawait/hugo-tranquilpeak-theme/milestone/17) - 1 nov 2017

- Support [prism.js](http://prismjs.com/) syntax highlighter in addition to _highlight.js_ ([#24](https://github.com/kakawait/hugo-tranquilpeak-theme/issues/24))

- Fix issue on global property `thumbnailimageposition` which was ignored ([#179](https://github.com/kakawait/hugo-tranquilpeak-theme/issues/179))
- Add global property to allow swapping pagination ([#202](https://github.com/kakawait/hugo-tranquilpeak-theme/pull/202))

### Breaking changes

Since new syntax highlighter prism.js, you have to configure which syntax highlighter you want to use between _highlight.js_ and _prism.js_. **However if you don't configure it, no syntax highligh will be apply** (where previously _highlight.js_ was forced by default).

Please upgrade you're `config.toml` (you can checkout `exampleSite/config.toml` to see sample) to re-add _highlight.js_ as syntax highlighter (except if you don't need it):

```toml
[params]
  # There is a typo on highligth.js (which should be highlight.js instead, please checkout version 0.4.3-BETA to get fix)
  syntaxHighlighter = "highligth.js"
```

## [0.4.1-BETA](https://github.com/kakawait/hugo-tranquilpeak-theme/milestone/16) - 11 sep 2017

- Fix _sharing options_ link generation bug, that break shares ([#196](https://github.com/kakawait/hugo-tranquilpeak-theme/pull/196))

- Fix menu ordering ([#149](https://github.com/kakawait/hugo-tranquilpeak-theme/issues/149), [#150](https://github.com/kakawait/hugo-tranquilpeak-theme/pull/150))
- Synch from Hexo Tranquilpeak theme 1.10 ([#147](https://github.com/kakawait/hugo-tranquilpeak-theme/pull/147), [#132](https://github.com/kakawait/hugo-tranquilpeak-theme/pull/132))
  - Italian translation

- Add theme version on meta tag ([#140](https://github.com/kakawait/hugo-tranquilpeak-theme/issues/140))

### Breaking changes

In order to fix menu ordering, you have to upgrade you `config.toml` to avoid any menu weight equals to `0`. See https://github.com/kakawait/hugo-tranquilpeak-theme/commit/f4feb3261381bd9a77be4da66d8466322886eb22#diff-991d2a2fe208cdee83955ad6e9a323a7 to get an full example.

With new _Sharing options_ that allow extensible list of sharing options, there is no more hardcoded sharing option inside template. Thus sharing options: Facebook, Twitter and Google plus should be reported inside your `config.toml` (you can checkout `exampleSite/config.toml` to see sample):

```toml
[params]
  [[params.sharingOptions]]
    name = "Facebook"
    icon = "fa-facebook-official"
    url = "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%s"

  [[params.sharingOptions]]
    name = "Twitter"
    icon = "fa-twitter"
    url = "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=%s"

  [[params.sharingOptions]]
    name = "Google+"
    icon = "fa-google-plus"
    url = "https://plus.google.com/share?url=%s"
```

- Fix `exampleSite/config.toml` about `customCSS` and `customJS` ([#137](https://github.com/kakawait/hugo-tranquilpeak-theme/issues/137), [#141](https://github.com/kakawait/hugo-tranquilpeak-theme/pull/141))
- Add meta tag `theme` that will contain theme version ([#140](https://github.com/kakawait/hugo-tranquilpeak-theme/issues/140), [#144](https://github.com/kakawait/hugo-tranquilpeak-theme/pull/144))
