### Breaking changes

#### Do not support anymore Hugo version < 0.53!

As `.Hugo` is deprecated, it has been replace by the global function `hugo` which appears in ([version 0.53](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/tag/v0.53)).

#### Do not support anymore Hugo version <= 0.30!

`coverImage` from `config.toml` now more consistent by do not fix default static folder to `images` (see [#327](https://github.com/kakawait/hugo-tranquilpeak-theme/issues/327) for more details).
`coverImage` from `param` will now always based on base path and not relative to current url, thus

```

will the be the same as

- Russian translation enhancement ([#227](https://github.com/kakawait/hugo-tranquilpeak-theme/pull/227))

### Breaking changes

Since I did an error on `highlight.js` for parameter `syntaxHighlighter`, sorry but you have to change it again for the correct typo

```toml

  syntaxHighlighter = "highlight.js"
```

## [0.4.2-BETA](https://github.com/kakawait/hugo-tranquilpeak-theme/milestone/17) - 1 nov 2017

- Add global property to allow swapping pagination ([#202](https://github.com/kakawait/hugo-tranquilpeak-theme/pull/202))

### Breaking changes

Since new syntax highlighter prism.js, you have to configure which syntax highlighter you want to use between _highlight.js_ and _prism.js_. **However if you don't configure it, no syntax highligh will be apply** (where previously _highlight.js_ was forced by default).

Please upgrade you're `config.toml` (you can checkout `exampleSite/config.toml` to see sample) to re-add _highlight.js_ as syntax highlighter (except if you don't need it):

```toml
[params]
  # There is a typo on highligth.js (which should be highlight.js instead, please checkout version 0.4.3-BETA to get fix)
  syntaxHighlighter = "highligth.js"
```

- Fix _sharing options_ link generation bug, that break shares ([#196](https://github.com/kakawait/hugo-tranquilpeak-theme/pull/196))

- Add theme version on meta tag ([#140](https://github.com/kakawait/hugo-tranquilpeak-theme/issues/140))

### Breaking changes

In order to fix menu ordering, you have to upgrade you `config.toml` to avoid any menu weight equals to `0`. See https://github.com/kakawait/hugo-tranquilpeak-theme/commit/f4feb3261381bd9a77be4da66d8466322886eb22#diff-991d2a2fe208cdee83955ad6e9a323a7 to get an full example.

With new _Sharing options_ that allow extensible list of sharing options, there is no more hardcoded sharing option inside template. Thus sharing options: Facebook, Twitter and Google plus should be reported inside your `config.toml` (you can checkout `exampleSite/config.toml` to see sample):

```toml
[params]
  [[params.sharingOptions]]
    name = "Facebook"
    icon = "fa-facebook-official"
    url = "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%s"

  [[params.sharingOptions]]
    name = "Twitter"
    icon = "fa-twitter"
    url = "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=%s"

  [[params.sharingOptions]]
    name = "Google+"
    icon = "fa-google-plus"
    url = "https://plus.google.com/share?url=%s"
```
